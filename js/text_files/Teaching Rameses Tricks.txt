Lesson One: Teaching Rameses Tricks

To teach Rameses how to do other things besides moving we can use functions. We can add functions to Rameses and make him do other things like saying his name or running in circles.

For example:

rameses.myName = function () {
	rameses.alert("My name is " + rameses.name);
};

This works because rameses had a name property, which allows us to get a string version of his name.
